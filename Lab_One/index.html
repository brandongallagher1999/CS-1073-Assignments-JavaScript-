       <p>For our first lab, we'll focus on the right way to add JavaScript, as well as creating code that is properly formatted and readable. Your job is to add the JavaScript included in the file main.js using a modern and appropriate script loading strategy. When you've accomplished this, you'll notice that the images on the page will change. </p>
       <p> You'll also notice that the code included in main.js is definitely not formatted according to best practice. This also means it's not very readable. It's your job to make it more readable by formatting it properly. You can use tools like beautifier.io or an extension that you've added to your code editor/IDE in order to format your JavaScript.</p>
